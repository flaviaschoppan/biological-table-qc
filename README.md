# Biological Table QC

## Methodological framework for integrity validation of biological result tables

---

## Overview

This repository presents a method-focused framework for validating the structural and numerical integrity of biological result tables generated by high-throughput experiments.

The objective is not biological interpretation, but to evaluate whether tabular outputs are internally consistent, numerically valid, and suitable for downstream analytical workflows.

The project reflects a quality-control mindset commonly required in translational research and industry environments, where analytical conclusions depend critically on the integrity of intermediate result tables.

## Analytical Scope

This work focuses on generic sanity checks applicable to biological result tables, independent of any specific experimental design or analytical pipeline.

The evaluated QC dimensions include:
- detection of missing or incomplete values,
- validation of numerical ranges (e.g., probability-constrained values),
- identification of type inconsistencies,
- inspection of distributional anomalies,
- detection of extreme or suspicious values.

All checks are rule-based and inspection-driven, emphasizing transparency over automation.

## Data

- Data type: biological result tables (tabular numeric outputs)
- Source: synthetically generated data for demonstration purposes

No real experimental or clinical data are distributed as part of this repository.

## Representative Outputs

This repository includes representative QC diagnostics illustrating common integrity issues encountered in biological result tables:

- distributional summaries of numeric columns,
- visualization of extreme or outlier values,
- structured textual QC reports highlighting detected inconsistencies.

These outputs are intended to demonstrate QC reasoning and inspection logic, not to support biological or statistical conclusions.

## Interpretation Notes

This project does not perform biological interpretation.
- No statistical testing or modeling is conducted.
- No automated pass/fail or decision criteria are defined.

All findings are methodological and illustrative.

## Intended Use

This repository is intended for:
- methodological evaluation of data integrity checks,
- inspection-driven QC design,
- demonstration of QC reasoning in biological data workflows.

It is not intended for:
- biological inference,
- differential analysis,
- clinical decision-making,
- production-grade automated pipelines.

## Implementation Notes

This repository emphasizes methodological structure and QC reasoning.

The implementation code included here is intentionally simple and modular, reflecting common industry practice where QC logic is adapted to specific data environments, infrastructure constraints, and regulatory contexts.
