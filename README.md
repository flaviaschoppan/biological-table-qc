# Biological Table QC  
**Quality Control for Biological Result Tables (Python)**

## Overview

This repository implements a small, modular pipeline for performing **quality control (QC) and sanity checks** on biological result tables, such as those generated in RNA-seq, proteomics, differential expression analysis, or other high-throughput experiments.

In real-world research workflows, downstream analysis is only as reliable as the **quality and consistency of the input tables**. This project focuses on detecting common data integrity problems **before any biological interpretation is attempted**.

---

## Why this matters in real research

After most bioinformatics pipelines, the typical output is a table containing values such as:

- Gene or feature identifiers  
- Log2 fold-changes or effect sizes  
- P-values or adjusted p-values  
- Expression or abundance measures  

Before any filtering, modeling, or interpretation, these tables must be checked for:

- Missing values  
- Invalid numerical ranges  
- Impossible biological values  
- Type inconsistencies  
- Extreme or suspicious outliers  

These checks are **rarely described in papers**, but they are **critical in regulated, clinical, and translational research environments**.

This project simulates this **data validation and QC stage** as a reproducible and modular Python workflow.

---

## What the pipeline checks

Given a biological results table, the pipeline currently performs:

- Detection of missing values per column  
- Detection of invalid p-values (outside the [0, 1] range)  
- Detection of negative expression values  
- Detection of non-numeric values in numeric columns  
- Detection of extreme / suspicious expression values  

---

## What the pipeline produces

- A structured QC report printed to the terminal  
- A saved text file: `qc_report.txt` summarizing all detected issues  
- Three QC diagnostic plots saved in the `outputs/` folder:
  - `expression_distribution.png` — histogram of mean expression values
  - `log2fc_distribution.png` — histogram of log2 fold-change values
  - `expression_boxplot.png` — boxplot highlighting outliers in expression values

---

## QC visual diagnostics

In addition to the textual report, the pipeline generates simple visual diagnostics to help quickly identify suspicious distributions and outliers:

- The expression distribution histogram helps detect scale issues and extreme values.
- The log2FC histogram helps reveal asymmetric or extreme fold-change distributions.
- The boxplot highlights outliers that may indicate data corruption, unit errors, or normalization problems.

These plots are not meant for biological interpretation, but for **sanity-checking the data before any downstream analysis**.

## How to run

1. Install dependencies
```text
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Generate synthetic example data
```text
python generate_example_data.py
```
This will create a synthetic dataset at:
```text
data/example_results.csv
```

3. Run the QC pipeline
```text
python run_qc.py
```

The pipeline will generate:
- A textual report: 
```text
qc_report.txt
```
- Three diagnostic plots in the 
```text
outputs/
```
folder


---

## Example output

The program will:
- Print a structured QC report to the terminal
- Save the same report to:
```text
qc_report.txt
```

The report lists:
- Which checks failed
- How many rows were affected
- Which genes/features are involved

## What this project represents

This project demonstrates:
- Awareness that data validation is a critical scientific step, not an afterthought
- Ability to translate biological data integrity rules into computational checks
- Modular code organization (I/O, validation, reporting)
- Reproducible, inspection-driven data analysis practices
- A mindset aligned with regulated and translational research workflows

## Notes

- This project uses a **synthetic dataset automatically generated by the pipeline** for demonstration and development purposes only.
- The `outputs/` folder contains generated files and is ignored by git.
- The project is designed to be extended with:
  - Additional biological consistency checks
  - More advanced QC visual diagnostics
  - Configurable thresholds
  - Automated fail/pass criteria for pipelines
